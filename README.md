<h1>
  Hi there! 👋 <br> 
  my name is Luiz, <br> 
  web developer 🤓 
</h1>

### A little on myself

<p>
  ⌛ I currently teach web development and build standards-based web apps and demos
  <br>
  🎯 I love JS & my main library I work with is React.js (and meta React frameworks)
  <br>
   🌱 I'm adding other JS frameworks to my belt, but slowly diving deeper into Rust and data-science
  <br>
  🧩 Outisde of dev work, I love listening to legal podcasts, tinkering with my SuperCoach side, skiing, cycling & helping others begin their dev journeys!
